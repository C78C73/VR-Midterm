# VR-Midterm
This is my vr project for my midterm. It's a "relaxing" project. 2 Experiences within for users to "relax" to, and music and alot of sweat and mental tears put into it. 

I have never grinded this hard before for a project. This was horrible and super hard. Unity doesnt work great. I've been on this since 12 PM and its 10: 50 at night. I've been fueling myself with water and trolli our gummy worms. I have a headache now, yet i still have to record a video on it, write a report, and submit the project in 2 different ways and create this repo. The zip file of this project is even to big for github to handle to upload.
